## Description
I was tasked with creating a coding quiz using Javascript. 

I listed the steps I needed to take to complete the assignment. I also fixed the link to the CSS.

I added the variable of questions which list the questions I would like to ask as objects within an array. I also added the score variable.

I added the questions and made it so that the starting menu is hidden and only the questions are displayed. I also added four options for each question.

I hid the questions at the end and had the score card displayed when the last question was displayed or when the time had run out. I also made it so that the timer was reduced by 10 seconds when a question was answered wrong.

I tried saving the highscores but it is not displaying the saved information. I also redirected the page.

I added feedback so that the program says if a question is right or wrong. I also mad the timer in the corner disappear once the quiz is over. I also stored the highscores in the local storage and called on the program to display them when the quiz is complete.
