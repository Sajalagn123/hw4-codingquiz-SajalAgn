## Description
I was tasked with creating a coding quiz using Javascript. 

I listed the steps I needed to take to complete the assignment. I also fixed the link to the CSS.

I added the variable of questions which list the questions I would like to ask as objects within an array. I also added the score variable.

I added the questions and made it so that the starting menu is hidden and only the questions are displayed. I also added four options for each question.
