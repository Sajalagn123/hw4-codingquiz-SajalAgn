## Description
I was tasked with creating a coding quiz using Javascript. 

I listed the steps I needed to take to complete the assignment. I also fixed the link to the CSS.

I added the variable of questions which list the questions I would like to ask as objects within an array. I also added the score variable.

I added the questions and made it so that the starting menu is hidden and only the questions are displayed. I also added four options for each question.

I hid the questions at the end and had the score card displayed when the last question was displayed or when the time had run out. I also made it so that the timer was reduced by 10 seconds when a question was answered wrong.

I tried saving the highscores but it is not displaying the saved information. I also redirected the page.

I added feedback so that the program says if a question is right or wrong. I also mad the timer in the corner disappear once the quiz is over. I also stored the highscores in the local storage and called on the program to display them when the quiz is complete. 

Removed logic.js as that file was empty and had no code.

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
